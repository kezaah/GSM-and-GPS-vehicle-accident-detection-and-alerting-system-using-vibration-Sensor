# Project-I
A GSM and GPS based vehicle accident detection and alerting system using vibration sensor.

## Features of the Project
-Detects accidents using a vibration sensor.
-Sends an alert notification to the user's phone.
-Sends the location details of the accident to a Firebase database.
-It has an abort button that can be used to cancel the alert notification.

## How to use
1. Connect the vibration sensor, GPS module, and GSM module to the Arduino.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino.
3. Set the threshold value for the vibration sensor.
4. Press the abort button if the accident is minor and no assistance is required.

## Dependencies
 Arduino IDE, Adafruit Vibration Sensor Library, TinyGPS++ Library, and Firebase Arduino Library.

## Components Used
* Arduino Uno
* Vibration sensor
* GPS module
* GSM module
* 10k ohm resistor
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires

## Installation Process
1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the Adafruit Vibration Sensor Library, TinyGPS++ Library, and Firebase Arduino Library.
3. Download the code from the project's GitHub repository.
4. Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
5. Set the threshold value for the vibration sensor.
6. Upload the code to the Arduino.

## Benefits of the Project
* The alert notification system can helps emergency contact to get to the accident scene quickly.
* The location details of the accident can be used to provide first responders with important information.
* The abort button can help to prevent unnecessary emergency calls.
